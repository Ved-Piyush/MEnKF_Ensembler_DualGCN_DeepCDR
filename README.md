# MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR
Matrix Ensemble Kalman Filter Model Averaging for DualGCN and DeepCDR Features

Please follow the following steps to reproduce the results in the manuscript

1. Download the [DualGCN Embeddings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cree-pkbQ_UxBF4pXaNoaf6TnYnQyAKr?usp=drive_link) and [DeepCDR Embeddings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W8aIdWcW_yeaXwajWOcWXMH2RQHP0FWc?usp=drive_link) and place them in the folders [DualGCN](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR/tree/main/DualGCN) and [DeepCDR](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR/tree/main/DeepCDR), respectively.

2. Run the script [Read_Data_DeepCDR_DualGCN.ipynb](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR/blob/main/Data_Preprocessing_Scripts/Read_Data_DeepCDR_DualGCN.ipynb) that will reindex the [DualGCN Embeddings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cree-pkbQ_UxBF4pXaNoaf6TnYnQyAKr?usp=drive_link) and [DeepCDR Embeddings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W8aIdWcW_yeaXwajWOcWXMH2RQHP0FWc?usp=drive_link) to have same `Cell_Line` IDs and `Drug_ID` along the rows for the training and the testing datasets. The reindexed files will be placed in the [Data](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR/tree/main/Data) folder.

3. Run the script [Reduce_Dimensions.ipynb](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR/blob/main/Data_Preprocessing_Scripts/Reduce_Dimensions.ipynb) which reduces the dimensionality of the embeddings by using Principal Component Analysis. The Principal Component Embeddings will be placed in the [Data](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR/tree/main/Data) folder. These Principal Component Embeddings would be used as features to the MEnKF method.

4. The MEnKF method is evaluated by taking 50 repeated random samples of size 2500 and 1000 for the training and testing sets, respectively. The MEnKF algorithm is run for 20 epochs on the training set and then evaluated on the corresponding testing set. Two scripts with slightly different hyperparameter configurations are [MEnKF_Model_Frozen_No_Activations_Parallel.ipynb](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR/blob/main/MEnKF_Scripts/MEnKF_Model_Frozen_No_Activations_Parallel.ipynb) and [MEnKF_Model_Frozen_No_Activations_Parallel_Trial_1.ipynb](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR/blob/main/MEnKF_Scripts/MEnKF_Model_Frozen_No_Activations_Parallel_Trial_1.ipynb). The evaluation metrics such as coverages, widths of prediction intervals, root mean squared errors, and Pearson Correlation Coefficient for the training and the testing sets across the 50 repeated samples will be placed in [Data](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR/tree/main/Data) folder.

5. Some plots such as the scatterplots of the actual test target values and the predictions from the MEnKF method and the histograms of the predictions from the MEnKF method overlaid with the ground truth value and the empirical 95% prediction intervals can be found at [MEnKF_Model_Frozen_No_Activations](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR/blob/main/MEnKF_Scripts/MEnKF_Model_Frozen_No_Activations.ipynb) and [MEnKF_Model_Frozen_No_Activations_Trial1](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/MEnKF_Ensembler_DualGCN_DeepCDR/blob/main/MEnKF_Scripts/MEnKF_Model_Frozen_No_Activations_Trial1.ipynb)
